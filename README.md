Operating Systems 

Operating System class, Fall 2016.

Four BIG assignments. I worked with a fellow student (Gurleen Kaur) in all of them. For the first time in my university carreer, I have experienced being overwhelmed by workload: we could not finish A4 in due time, in fact most files for that assignments are incomplete

A1 -> interceptor.h, interceptor.c, test_full.c, test_intercept.c

A2 -> cars.c, traffic.h, traffic.c

A3 -> clock.c, fifo.c, opt.c, lru.c, pagetable.c, pagetable.h, rand.c, sim.h, sim.c, swap.c

A4 -> ext2_checker.c, ext2_cp.c, ext2_helper.h, ext2_helper.c, ext2_ln.c, ext2_mkdir.c, ext2_restore.c, ext2_rm.c, ext2.h
